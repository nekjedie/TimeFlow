# TimeFlow
A modern time management and time tracking application built with C# and the .NET ecosystem.

TimeFlow started as a personal learning project to deepen my knowledge of C#, software architecture, databases, and modern .NET development practices. At the same time, it solves a real problem: after several useful features in my favorite time management app became part of their paid plans, I decided to build my own solution that I can fully customize and use on a daily basis.

The project follows an incremental approach. Development starts with a console application to focus on C# fundamentals, object-oriented programming, CRUD operations, and database integration. Once the core functionality is stable, the application will evolve into a full ASP.NET Core web application.

## Current Development Phase

**Phase 1: Console Application**

The current goal is to build and validate the core business logic:

* Create, read, update, and delete projects
* Create, read, update, and delete time entries
* Start and stop timers
* Generate daily, weekly, monthly and yearly overviews
* Persist data using a database
* Build a clean and maintainable architecture

After the foundation is complete, the project will move to the web.

**Phase 2: Web Application**

Planned improvements:

* User authentication
* Responsive web interface
* Dashboard and analytics
* Multiple projects and categories
* CSV import and export
* Dark mode
